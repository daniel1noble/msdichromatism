##Sexual and natural selection on colour signals in Sri-Lankan Horned lizards

This repo allows reproducibility of all analyses, tables and figures in the following paper:

Martin J. Whiting, Daniel W.A. Noble and Ruchira Somerweera. Sexual dimorphism in conspicuousness and ornamentation in an enigmatic lizard from Sri Lanka, the leaf-nosed lizard **Ceratophora tennentii**. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, in press.

This paper is not yet published, but has been accepted for publication. 

To reproduce all analyses Rscript("Analysis/analysisALL-00.R") from the folder directory in terminal. This can also be acheived by running in R:  

```{r}
source("./Analysis/analysisALL-00.R")
```

Model checking dignostic plots will be produced when analysis is run so you should supress these if you don't want to see them.
